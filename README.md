A KNN for handwritten single digits based on water retention from various directions split into quadrants. Not remarkably accurate and could certainly be optimized.

Extracted Dataset not included for the sake of not uploading it all. The scored dataset is in ```digit_scores.py``` though so it isnt needed for use.

Complete with user interface and graphics wow!
